# K-Nearest-Neighbors

# Tasks

- Take input from “train.txt” and plot the points with different colored markers according to the assigned class label.

- Implement KNN algorithm. The value of K will be taken from user. Classify the test points from “test.txt” with different colored markers according to the predicted class label.

- Print the top K distances along with their class labels and the predicted class to “prediction.txt” for each of the test data.
